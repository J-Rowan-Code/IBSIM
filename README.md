# IBSIM
An interactive educational simulation
This was a project I created with 2 peers.
It is written in Java.
I did all of the coding, one peer did all of our documentation, and a third did all of the animation.
This was designed for a teacher to use in her lessons to detail interactions between cells in the body, namely interactions between bacteria, antibiotics and white blood cells.
The project has an executable that is launchable with a double click (requires Java runtime environment) as well as the source files.
